<h2>Approach</h2>
After brief consideration, we concluded that since the tasks mostly build up on each other, it would be counterproductive to divide the workload. Instead, we will work through them sequentially together.

<h3>2026/01/20</h3>
<li>Set up project structure</li>
<li>Config files (docker-compose.yml, mosquitto.conf, .env, .env.example)</li>
<li>For formatting and linting: Ruff + Black</li>

<h3>2026/01/21</h3>
<li>Wrote Dockerfiles for sensor_simulator and fastapi_backend</li>
<li>Got to work on sensor_simulator's main.py</li>
