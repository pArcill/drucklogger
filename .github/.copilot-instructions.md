**Project Overview:**

You are tasked with building a complete "IoT Pressure Logger" system from scratch.
The system will simulate distributed sensors that measure atmospheric pressure, collect this data via a messaging system, store it in a database, and present it via a Web Dashboard.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Language**: Python 3.14+
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Messaging**: MQTT (Eclipse Mosquitto)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with SQLModel)
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI (Backend API)
- **Frontend**: Nginx (serving HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

**General Guidelines for Implementation:**

- Follow the PEP 8 style guide.
- Use type hints for all function signatures.
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes.
- Provide ample documentation for any and all changes made; where needed, create separate documentation files.
- When implementing new features, also include extensive PyTests for them in the appropriate location in src/test.
